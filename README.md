## PSTAT 126: Regression Analysis 
### Advanced Statistical Analysis of Red Wine Quality
- Project measuring response and performing a thorough statistical analysis on red wine quality.
- Feature engineering various chemical properties, attributes, and quality ratings.
- Launched a comprehensive data analysis project aimed at exploring the relationship between physicochemical properties of red wine
and its quality ratings. Involving four major steps, focusing on different aspects of statistical data analysis and model building.
- Conducted thorough EDA on a dataset of red wine characteristics, involving 1,599 instances and 12 variables. Employed techniques
for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization to identify patterns, anomalies, and distribution characteristics.
- Developed and refined multiple statistical models, from MLR to advanced models including Ridge, LASSO, WLS, and Clustering to
predict wine quality. Focused on model selection, feature engineering, and statistical inference.
- Implemented shrinkage methods to address multicollinearity and enhance model performance. Utilized cross-validation to optimize
regularization parameters between desired models.
- Synthesized complex results into a digestible presentation for a non-technical audience, highlighting business incentives. Prepared a
professional, comprehensive report, detailing each project step, methodologies, findings, and limitations.
- Coded in R utilizing core libraries like ggplot2, tidymodels, glmnet, and tree, applying aspects of PCA.
- Displayed strong foundations of statistical analysis, model building, cross-validation, visualization, advanced regression techniques,
problem-solving, and technical communication through engineering design practices.
